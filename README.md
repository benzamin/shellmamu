##Install
Download or clone this repo, then from terminal, first go to the downloaded/cloned folder, then run
```
$ sudo sh install
```
Note that, mamu needs your admin access/password to get copied in the system folder.

##Usage
Just write any command, and mamu will ask you for needed parameters, like-
```
mamu countdown
```
And it'll ask for how many seconds it will countdown
```
::TIPS:: You can also use countdown command like - $ mamu countdown 10  
 How many seconds you want to countdown? ->  4
 ```
 And thats how it all works.

$ mamu help (Prints help for all available commands)
$ mamu countdown (counts down with voice feedback a certain amount of seconds)
$ mamu findnreplace (finds given text and replaces it with a new one in a file)
$ mamu findtext (finds given text in a file or folder and shows a list of them)
